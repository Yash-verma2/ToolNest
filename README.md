# ToolNest — Premium Static Starter (Light + Animations)

You asked for:
- Light minimal premium UI + subtle animations (Lottie)
- Fullscreen modern sections (hero, features, tools)
- Tools: QR Generator, Meme Maker, PDF Tools (merge, image->pdf), Unit Converter
- Cards for tools that look professional

How to use:
- Open index.html in a browser (or host on GitHub Pages / Netlify)
- All tools are client-side where possible; PDF merging uses pdf-lib and runs in-browser.
- For real production (ads, analytics, payments) migrate to Next.js and add backend APIs for heavier ML tasks.

Files:
- index.html
- tools/qr.html
- tools/meme.html
- tools/pdf.html
- tools/unit.html

Built quickly to a high visual standard. Tell me what to tweak (fonts, colors, animations) and I will update the zip.
